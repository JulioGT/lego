## Description

This app imports `react-bootstrap/Carousel` library and a new Component `(Carousel)` was created with that library.

The `Carousel` Component receives two props:

1. delay
2. children

The `delay` parameter receives the amount of time (in milliseconds) to delay between automatically cycling an item. If a non-integer value is sent, the app will not show the next slide. Instead, you will have to do it manually by clicking "Next" or "Previous".

The `children` parameter receives the slides to show, each slide contains the following fields.

<ul>
  <li>title</li>
  <li>description</li>
  <li>lego images</li>
</ul>

`Example:` <br />

```yaml
[
  {
    title: "First Demo",
    description: "Awesome Slider... Fisrt position",
    imgURL: "https://www.example1.com/img1.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Second Demo",
    description: "Awesome Slider... Second position",
    imgURL: "https://www.example1.com/img2.jpg",
  },
  {
    title: "Third Demo",
    description: "Awesome Slider... Third position",
    imgURL:"https://www.example1.com/img3.jpg",
  },
]
```

<br />
All of these fields will be shows for every slide.
